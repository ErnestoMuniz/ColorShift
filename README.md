An extension for Google Chrome (and Chromium) that applies a filter on the webpage, so that it makes the colors more vivid and easy to differ.

Important

------------

  

- If the website already uses a filter in its css, the elements might change their original location when applying ColorShift. To get them back, just select the option <b>deactivate</b> and refresh the page if it doesn't do it by itself.

- ColorShift works in all tabs and the filter is applied when the tab is <b>fully loaded<b>.
